## KATA SKELETON DANIELESAULSCILLIA - PHP VERSION

# FIZZ BUZZ
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

`vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit tests`

# Branch objective
In this branch I will try to solve Fizz Buzz strictly following:
- TDD
- Object Calisthenics Rules

## Workflow

1. Write a red test
2. Make the test green ASAP following either "Fake it" / "Obvious implementation" / "Triangulation" strategies of TDD
3. Refactor the code, one small step at a time, keeping tests green at each step; when to refactor
    1. duplication
    2. any of Object Calisthenics rules is not respected
